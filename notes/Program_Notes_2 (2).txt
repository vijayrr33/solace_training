Quiz Session : Tue - Thu [8-10] :: Cross Group Quizzing

- Finalize the list of topics
- Each Group : 7 questions to another group || Answer 7 questions from another group
- NO LOLLI questions

Files : Data/Config/API details/Credentials/Dump the entire data

File types : 

- .txt
- .xml
- .json 
- Excel/Word doc

File Reading + File Writing

E1 : Need --> NodeJS file [.js file] + .txt file [ref file] 

- Write a NodeJS code 
- Read from a .txt file
- Data would be displayed 

file name : filefs1.js - node code
ref file : node1.txt

--> Create the text file : node1.txt 
--> Add some data 
--> Write the node code

JS reads from top to bottom, unless, there are specific calls are made

E1 : fs.readFileSync
E2 : fs.readFile

Dynamic programming languages : JS/NodeJS/Python/Ruby/Scala/GoLang 

If sync method/func is to be used :: Method ending with the word "sync" --> readFileSync()
If async method :: default :: readFile()

function (err, data) {
   if (err) return console.error(err);
   console.log(data.toString());


Callback functions - Function within function

function (err, data) { 

//code

}


fs.readFile('node1.txt', function (err, data) {
   if (err) return console.error(err);
   console.log(data.toString());
});


1st func : readFile :: Inside the readFile() param :: "file name == node1.txt" 

[executing a check function] :: 

2nd func: function (err, data) {
   if (err) return console.error(err);


Before the action --> console.log(data.toString());


//non-blocking code - async code

//even with errors in the callback block :: remaining code would execute with the error logs


var fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile('node.txt', function (err, data) {
   if (err) return console.error(err);
   console.log(data.toString());
});

console.log("Program Ended");
console.log("Program Ended2");


==> How to read the text files
==> Within the text files :: Operate on the file :

- Sync
- Async

==> flow of the callback func

======> Read a JSON file :: JavaScript Object Notation

1. Why do we use JSON files ?

a. JSON are mainly used for data carrier 
b. One of the main areas of JSON files utility :: Configuration
c. Why use JSON files :: <why not XML> :: JSON file processing is FASTER than XML or SQL Databases :: Processing faster --> Traversing the data + Locating a data is faster [because it uses light-weight JS]

2. What is the format in which the data is stored in JSON file: 

a. Key-Value pair format
b. Key-value pair should be "unique" 
c. Keys can have a string/number/float/list [collection] as a value

fname: "Tom"
age: 30


emp_id : "id"
{
emp_fname: "Tom"
}


customer_fname: "Tom" --> Incorrect way to identify a unique data set

Use ID's as the primary keys

[{"name":"Solace1",

"age":25,

"language":["NodeJS","Event","Messaging"]}


==> Create the JSON file [users1.json]
==> Create the NodeJS file [json1.js]

both the files are in the same dir

Incorrect JSON file : error on the JSON file structure:

node: internal/modules/cjs/loader: [Not from custom code base BUT NodeJS internals] 

CJS --> Common JavaScript

Solace : 

console.solace.cloud

Status Dashboard of Solace PubSub+ :

a. High Avalability --> Single Node
b. DMR Cluster

i. Hostname : mr-connection-vh0scnp4ytw.messaging.solace.cloud
ii. Cluster Name
iii. Message-VPN

c. Management Access : User + Passwd

==> What is a cluster? :: Collection --> Servers/Databases

--> Hostname
--> High Availability :: Single Node


Nodes :: Invidual Hosts ==> Machines [Physical/VM] 

The EBS service that we are running using the Developer class a/c --> Running on a single node --> HostName

Whenever a server instance is created [physical/VM] :: Will have a hostname associated

Solace PubSub+ :

a. EBS --> Running on a cluster
b. How many nodes on the cluster --> 1 [Single Node] 
c. The node will have a Host Name 
d. Node will also have a credentials for access

Using Putty :: Connect from a Windows machine to a Linux machine

Tool :: Putty --> Protocol (SSH : 22) :: Local machine [Windows] ---> Remote machine [PubSub+ cloud is running] [hostname, etc is provided] 


Tools available :

a. Putty - Windows OS
b. OpenSSH  - Linux/Mac OS

Local :: Laptop/Desktop [windows] --> Remote [Node on which Solace EBS is running] --> mr-connection-vh0scnp4ytw.messaging.solace.cloud [hostname is available]

Are all the port open? Yes or NO 

Never a good practice to keep all the port numbers opened :: because if the ports are open ==> chances of unauthorized access and cyber attacks that can happen

If SSH communication has to happen :: Putty :: Need to keep Port 22 open

How to open + check if port 22 is opened in Solace account? 

How to check the Port Number --> 

Solace Console --> Cluster Manager --> CLick on the service [EBS] --> Manage Tab --> Port Configuration ==> Click on ... and select Edit --> Management --> Save

Started the Putty --> Copied the Management Editor Username --> Entered in Putty --> Copied the Management Editor Password [selected the password + ctrl-c] --> Paste the password in putty --> A "single RIGHT-CLICK" from my mouse

Connect to the Putty? 

Session getting killed is a common problem :: How to resolve this problem? 

Putty --> Connections --> Seconds between "keep alive" [keeps sending heart beats between the Local m/c and remote server] 

Putty :: Solace CLI --> All the Solace commands are worked using Solace CLI

--> Solace PubSub+ Cloud :: GUI
--> Solace CLI [Command Line Interaction] :: Solace Commands

- dir

- cd /logs

- dir

Different log files in Solace : 

a. command.log
b. debug.log
c. kernel.log
d. system.log

Working with EBS  :: 


Diagram :

1. What is the Solace "layer" - Event Broker Service

2. What is "Shipping", "Customer History", "Credit Auth", "Email"  --> Subscriber clients/services/consumers

3. What is mobile app/catalogue app/storefront app --> Publishers Clients/Services/Consumers

Publisher <==EBS Service==>  Subscriber 

Solace Console ==> Where can we publish or subscribe to a message OR topic? ==> Try-Me



Path :: Endpoint :: What will this endpoint hold --> Secure Web Service [WSS]

Publish Path [Broker URL]: wss://mr-connection-vh0scnp4ytw.messaging.solace.cloud:443

Subscribe Path [Broker URL]: wss://mr-connection-vh0scnp4ytw.messaging.solace.cloud:443

Hostname of the EBS :: mr-connection-vh0scnp4ytw.messaging.solace.cloud

Both Pub & Sub are pointing to the same path :: Port Number : 443 [https :: Channel of data transferring would be secure]


<Publisher> [Establish Connection ==>   Broker URL --> the location where EBS is residing] <Subscriber>

Broker URL :: <Broker> + <URL>

Event Broker service :: Can be of 2 types : "Software" + Hardware 

If the Event Broker is a software service --> It has to run as a service :: URL/URI [API endpoints] 

In order to access the event broker service [software nature] --> URI or URL :: Broker URL --> Where the broker service is running ["path" to my host + "port number"]

Quick question : What resides in Endpoints? :: Service --> Web Services or the API endpoints --> business feature and functionalities --> Schema, Application Domain, Entity relationships

Which side to connect first ? Sub or Pub?

--> Subscribers :: There is a demand on the subscriber end, the EBS will try to check what are the incoming events/messages from Publisher


Topic ==> Is a chapter in a book

[Publisher] ---> [Publish to the topic : try-me] ------------>  [EBS : Broker URL] <------------- [Topic - try-me] <--- Subscriber-Service [Print]

Once a message is published ---> Publisher is NOT bothered who is consuming the message, what happens to the message, who subscribes to the message, what is happening with the message

Publisher :: Amazon --> New-Order-Service :: Captures the order details ---> Push it forward

The publisher is publishing it's own topics [t1]

The subscriber is subscribing to it's own topics [t2] 

Step 1: "Publishing" to the topic  : try-me-2 :: Success
Step 2: "Subscribe" to the topic  : try-me-2 :: Topic listing is working BUT the event/message has NOT been captured

Create a new account [today] in Zomato --> Offers from [today] / Discounts from [today] 


===> Publishers --> Once a topic [messages + events is published] --> only and only the subscribed topics/services can get the details

Solace Pub-Sub topics are case sensitive

Messages can be published in 2 ways :: Solace :: 

a. Binary
b. text

Subscriber side :: List of topics being subscribed to
Publisher side :: There is NO list of topics being published

From the publisher side :: If a topic is being published and the Topic has a subscriber on the subcriber side, every new published message will be available for subscription by the subscriber service

If the above is NOT the behavior, for every topic subscriptions, millions of new topics would have to be created.

Topic : New-Order :: Order details different [messages are different] 

Throttle Request


1. Open the "Run"
2. Navigated inside the directory 
3. mkdir nodesol2
4. cd nodesol2

==> We will initialize a NodeJS application/code base

Create an application :: Development + QA code + Dependencies [libraries/packages/etc etc] :: Structure --> Dependency manage

==> We will initialize a NodeJS application/code base :: <from the root/dir/folder of the app> npm init

npm init

NPM : Node package manager : https://www.npmjs.com/

<from the root/dir/folder of the app> npm init 

--> Ask some configuration details --> Insert the values as needed or keep the default or keep them empty

--> package.json :: Package manager file [All the packages needed in the app, can be placed in this file]

--> Sync vs Asynchronous

New things : In the async func :

- setTimeout : Tries to check how long the func loop can execute before the timeout is called

- Promise.resolve() : Promise is a func call in NodeJS which states that :: Once the calling functions are in the Promise loop --> they will be executed

Async feature --> In NodeJS --> 

a. Promises :: will have different states :

i. Resolve
ii. Await
iii. Reject


- .then()

Async --> NodeJS :: 

a. generic func calls
b. Loops within Promise.resolve()
c. setTimeout

Install the async package 

C:\nodesample\nodesol2> npm install async

async0.js : 

function square(x) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(Math.pow(x, 3));
        }, 2000);
    });
}

async function output(x) {
    const ans = await square(x);
    console.log(ans);
}

MicroTask.js :: Promise.resolve()
setTimeout(logG, 0);

Code Syntax 

Another state of Promise : Promise { <pending> }

Promise --> Promise function (whose scope is resolved()) is called in another async function, await needs to be implemented. 

Promise - Resolve - Await

const async = require("async");


function square(a, b) {
	return new Promise(resolve => {
		setTimeout(() => {
			resolve(a + b);
		}, 2000);
	});
}

async function output(c, d, e) {
	const ans = await square(c, d, e);
	console.log(ans);
	console.log(e);
}

async function output1(x, y) {
	const ans1 = await square(x,y);
	console.log(ans1);
	// console.log(e);
}

output(10, 20, 20);
output1(45, 45);

Solace --> Within Solace

- EBS --> Cluster Manager + Schema + App Domains
- data centers
- Port no. config
- Solace CLI : How to connect through Putty/Hostnames/Management Creds/dir/cd /logs
- Pub-Sub : Try Me
- What is the structure of the connection :: Broker URL's 

EBS --> Pub-Sub :: Queues

1. What are queues? :

- Storage of the messages/event data 
- Event data/message packets that comes from publisher
- Queue :: Temp storage :: The storage is used between Publisher events vs Subscriber events
- Queues communicate with Topics to hold the information/data

- Publishers would publish messages to the queues --> <Directly pass the data to the subs OR Hold the data for "X" period of time]

--> What is present within the queues :

a. message ID's
b. meta information about the messages
c. Replication information

Queues in Solace : Queues can be of 2 types :

a. Durable queues : 

- Type of persistent queue : Queue remains :: "Guaranteed delivery"
- Durable queues can only & only be removed by the administrator of solace
- It is the queues that identifies the state of the subscriber [wrto the topics] 
- Durable queues will load the messages from the pub apps, irrespective the state of the subs
- If the sub app is offline, durable queue will wait/persist the message till the subs app is ONLINE

b. Non-durable queue :

- Temporary queue
- Runs on the lifecycle of a consumer/subscriber
- As long as the client state is RUNNING, the non-durable queue is ON
- When the client has SHUT DOWN/OFF, the non-durable queue is deleted
- Non-persistent 

Solace handles both persistent & non-persistent event storages using queues.

HAA :: High Availability Architecture :: 99.99% uptime

Solace : Software EBS + Hardware EBS :: HAA :: 99.9% 

Another feature of Solace queues is :

a. Persistent Storage 
b. Guaranteed Delivery

2. Why do we need queues?

- Storages
- Ensures message delivery
- Maintain the state of load between the PUB and SUB

3. How to setup queues :
a. Web GUI
b. Solace CLI
4. Queues parameters
5. Queue stats

How to setup the Queues using PubSub+ Cloud :: WebGUI

cluster manager <-----event broker service <---- Queues

Cluster Manager --> EBS --> Manage Tab --> Queues --> "Create Queue"

Queue configuration/setting :

a. Incomi==> Incoming & Outgoing : messages coming and going out wrto queue

Queues can do bi-directional or uni-directional comm

b. Message queued quota :: Size of the "overall" messages that can be present in the queue

c. Access Type : 

- Exclusive : s2 - s3 - s1 - s4
- Non-exclusive : <Round robin fashion> 

Subscription request has been made for a topic [/hello] to the queue in the following manner :

-> S2
-> S3
-> S1
-> S4

Place an order in Zomato :

Pub: New-Order --> Restaurant || Delivery --> Customer Service 

Sub : Customer Support

Accounting
Delivery
Restaurant

d. Owners : 

a. Whenever a queue is created :: Who is the owner from the client [client-username :: will have some specific permissions associated with them] 

b. By default :: Queue owners would have the permission to DELETE the queues



Walk to a restaurant --> Sit in the table :: Can you break the table & chair? :: NO :: Because YOU are NOT the owner of the table & chair --> Non-owner entity

Queues :: Different businesses/services/organizations within a business

Citi Bank :: Multiple queues in EBS :: 

- Transaction-queue
- login-queue
- customerservice-queue

citi-singapore
citi-london
citi-dubai

e. Non-owner Permission 

No Access 
Disallows all access.
Read Only 
Read-only access to the messages.
Consume 
Consume (read and remove) messages.
Modify Topic 
Consume messages or modify the topic/selector.
Delete 
Consume messages, modify the topic/selector or delete the Client created endpoint altogether.

Consume :: Read + remove the messages

f. Maximum consumer count :: This is the number of clients that can get connected from the pub & sub sides

==> Queue List :: Queue listing page
==> Select a queue :: Navigate inside the details of that queue

Queues | queue01 :: Details page

a. Messages Queued

b. Incoming vs Outgoing rate - At pace/speed the messages comes in and goes out of the queue

- Will determine how the queue capacity is working

- How well the messages/events are processed by the queue

- How the pub & sub services are working

- 100 msgs/sec vs 10,000 msgs/sec [Think about the capacity of the Solace EBS being used]

Whenever a queue is  created --> The queue ideally would subscribe to the Topics

Topic Subscriptions in Queues ::


Queues --> Select the specific queue --> Subscriptions --> Add Subsccriptions

Queue --> Topic Subscription --> Messages? [NO messages]


Queue --> Topic Subscription [subscribed] --> Messages :: Add messages --> Publish messages to the topic

--> Solace API's :: NodeJS/Java/Python/etc

--> Solace PubSub+ :: TryME

message exchange pattern :

- Point-Point :: Direct comm :: Client-receiver

- Pub-Sub comm pattern :: Comm is using the EBS + Queues

Point-to-Point : 

With point-to-point messaging, messages sent by the producer are processed by a "single consumer"

Message Exchange Patterns:

Most messaging applications use the following messaging exchange patterns:

Publish-Subscribe
Point-to-Point
Request-Reply

--> Created a queue with config details 

--> Within the queue --> 2 Topic subscriptions 

--> Try Me :: 

a. Topic 1 :: Sub --> Pub :: There was no updated on the queue

b. Topic 2 :: Simply published --> Subsccription in the queue got activated --< Message queue in the queue


Queue :

a. With or without subscribe :: The messages are queued

b. MessageID : Message ID is synchronization ::

Queue01 : Msg ID : 1-3
Queue02 : Msg ID : 4

Queue01 --> try-me : 	2023-08-08 13:14:33

Queue :: 2 set of configuration :: 

Queue created --> Property :: BY default the queue created :: Durable

Access Type of the queue :: Exclusive 

What is the maximum limit that can be used for :

a. Consumer count
b. Size of message queued


What is the total volume of data that my Solace account can hold? 

Service Type: Developer

Guaranteed messaging :: Storage capacity :: 10 GB
Client connection :: 100

Queue --> Owner --> Client-username :: Where can I add a new client-username? 

Cluster Manager --> EBS service --> Manage tab --> Access Control --> Client user names

<pub> :: Queue :: <sub> :: Who should send the acknowledgement : Acknowledgments :

a. Is ack compulsory? :: Not always compulsory [Good practice to have the ack  BUT not compulsory] 

Durable vs Non-Durable queues

Durable queues :: ACK is MUST
Non-Durarable queues :: ACK is not MUST

b. Is it possible to No Ack? :: No acknowledgement --> NACK :: YES NACK can be enabled

c. What will be sent as an acknowledgement? :: 

message/topics from queues --> subscribed --> subscriber [services] :: Fetch/receive the message + Process the message

As long as the message is NOT processed, Durable Queue --> The message is NOT deleted

==> Subscriber would send the ACK to the EBS, when the message is processed

==> When the EBS receives a confirmation that message has been processed ==> delete the message from the queue

You created : What are these entities called in terms of Solace ? :: "Objects" in Solace

- EBS
- Pub & Sub
- Queues
- Topic Subscriptions

===> Bunch of configurations

Solace uses REST Architecture --> Every entity that is created is a Resource :: Each resource would have it's own unique/object ID

Event ID from 07/08 : 

Event ID
16xfzbvaj

Event ID from 07/08 : 

Event ID
16xfzcihj

In Solace, every entity is an Object with a unique Object ID associated with it.
 
Every time an EBS is created, by default --> Message-VPN gets created

Message-VPN?

Every Solace object + Every actions :: Within the message-VPN

All actions [creating objects/configuring objects/deleting objects] that are performed in Solace PubSub+ cloud a/c --> Message-VPN

Message-VPN : 

--> Message :: Solace message

--> VPN :: Virtual Private Network 

Developer class --> Restriction :: 1 message VPN

Solace CLI :: How to work with Queues : 

- Client restrictions
- Any sort of configuration of the parameters :: Solace CLI
- CLI is cool

--> Start the CLI :

- Putty
- Port 22 is open is Solace
- Hostname
- Management Creds

1. Before creating the queue :: Define the message-spool :: message-VPN

get inside the:  message-spool message-vpn <my-message-vpn-name> 

solace-primary-0(configure/message-spool)

2. Command to create the queue :

create queue <queue name>

create queue queuecli01

3. After the queue is created :: Size of the queue ::

max-spool-usage <value = MB]

max-spool-usage 50

4. Permission :: Owner + Non-owner

By default :: owner --> default 

Non-owner :: command : permission all <type of permission> 

permission all consume

5. Ensure that :: The queue object that's created --> State of the object should be always ON

Any object that is created :: SHUT or NO SHUT state

The queue that is created --> NO SHUT state :: command : no shut

6. See the queue that we just created

show queue <queue name> 

show queue queuecli01

7. Detailed state of the queue : 

show queue <queue name> detail

show queue queuecli01 detail

8. Subscribing to a Topic :

Publisher --> Events --> Messages [text/binary] --> Solace [EBS] --> Sub Services



==> How does Solace communicate across the different objects ? 

Queues --> Topics --> messages [Pub& Sub] 

1. Amazon.com --> https://www.amazon.com --> Port: 443 + Using Https protocol + TCP + Request-Response model

2. Cross a busy road --> Left + Right :: Protocol

3. How does Solace communicate across the different objects ? 

Queues --> Topics --> messages [Pub& Sub] 


- Which protocol Solace has to follow? :: Solace --> messaging activities : SMF :: Solace message format
- Protocol - Service -- Port number :: SMF works : 

https://docs.solace.com/Admin/Default-Port-Numbers.htm

55555	Solace Message Format (SMF)	
55003	SMF compressed	
55556	SMF routing	
55443	SMF TLS / SSL (with or without compression)

In a network, data communication can happen in 2 ways :

- In a compressed format : Network lag is reduced + Speed is better
vs
- In a uncompressed format

55556	SMF routing : Multiple message-VPN's are to connected

	

Solace supports:

a. Multiple languages : Python/Java/NodeJs/C#/etc
b. Multiple protocols : 2 types :

- Solace specific protocol -  SMF :: Solace message format
- 3rd party protocols - AMQP [Active message queue protocol] / MQTT / REST API

Solace developer account : Secured SMF Host
Enabled
Port : 55443

Virtual ports : 0-65535

0-1200 : System protocols 
1201-1300 : research purpose

1. What is an event, as in Solace? 

https://docs.solace.com/Get-Started/understanding-events-messaging.htm

https://solace.com/blog/inside-solace-message-introduction/

Events : 

a. Can be anything in which there is a change of state of data
b. Events can be generated by manual intervention OR dynamically

Manual : 

- click a button
- click on tab

Dynamic : 

- messages would try to communicate among each other : EDA :: Pub-Sub

c. What are these change of data state : Whenever we deal with data-driven app [eg : Banking/Amazon/Gaming//Zomato/etc] : What are the different states :

CRUD

C : Create : Create a new record in the data store
R : Read : List of data 
U : Update : Modify/alter the existing data : 10/08 --> 12/08
D : Delete : Remove the record

Zomato <new order> -------> <res or customer support or delivery> 

Zomato <new order> ===> <Topic [NewOrderTopic-Date] = <message> : New-Order-date-resname-<items+ quan>-zipcode> </message> <=== subscribe (restaurant serv/customer serv/delivery serv) to the topic : [NewOrderTopic-Date]] 


Zomato <modify order> ===> <Topic [ModifyOrderTopic-Date] = <message> : Modify-Order-date-resname-<items+ quan>-zipcode> </message> <=== subscribe (restaurant serv/customer serv/delivery serv) to the topic : [NewOrderTopic-Date]] 


Zomato <delete order> ===> <Topic [DeleteOrderTopic-Date] = <message> : Delete-Order-date-resname-<items+ quan>-zipcode> </message> <=== subscribe (restaurant serv/customer serv/delivery serv) to the topic : [NewOrderTopic-Date]] 

Different services ==> Create different events [CRUD] ==> Send the messages :: <Topic Subscriptions> ==> <Queues [messagesID's + meta data + Topic subs]>  <=== subscriber [subscribed to the topic]

Event is a logical step
Data --> messages --> topics --> queues :: <===Subs


What is the structure of the message? 

Laptop 1----------------> Laptop2 : LAN 

Laptop 1----------------> Web : WAN

TCP Packets ==> Each of the packets would have a structure associated


What is the structure of the message? 

EBS :: Event Streaming :: Read about "Event Streaming" || How event streaming works in EDA

https://solace.com/blog/inside-solace-message-introduction/

Solace Message structure :

a. Header : Source/Delivery address/Delivery mode/return address/Port --> Meta data 

b. Body : Which holds the data + Actual data --> Application data --> Payload


==> Message exchange pattern : How the messages can move from Pub-<EBS or Queue - Topics>-Sub

a. P2P
b. Request-Reply
c. Pub-Sub

==> What are the delivery modes in Solace Messaging

https://docs.solace.com/Get-Started/message-delivery-modes.htm

2 types of delivery modes :

a. Direct Messaging :

- At times there can be the data loss
- If the client is OFFLINE, EBS will not hold the data
- Pub --> Sub service can communicate directly


b. Guaranteed Messaging : Is called as Persistent messaging :: messages are stored in the EBS || High Availability of the data || Even if the client isn't online, the message will persist, untill the client consumes the messages

Guaranteed messaging :: Topic subscriptions are associated with an endpoint on the "broker" rather than consuming clients

Template : Ready solution or DIY :: Buckets [config params] --> data that we can work with it --> Re-usable

Queue :: 

Created a queue :: We assigned some configurations to that queue

Queues :: Solace env --> Dynamically created --> What will be the config :: if the config is to be available :: manual approach ----------------> templatized approach

Template :: Create ONCE, Reuse Again, again, again

Solace --> Creating and using Templates :: Queue templates

Generic Templates :: Can be used by the Pub Services OR Sub Services : Endpoint URI's 

Solace : 2 types of templates ==> Endpoint Templates :

a. Queue templates/Queue endpoints
b. Topic Endpoints

Endpoint links : https://docs.solace.com/Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Endpoint-Templates.htm

Queue Name Filter

Zomato :: Get a list of all the users who belongs to a pincode : 400100 || 400<followed by 3 digits> || begins with 4? 

Topics : try-me, hello1, hello2

<business> : zomato
<application/service> : customers
<what is the search crtiteria> : zip code
What is the value of the Zip code : <Specific> OR <Pattern>

Pattern :: In computer science, how to define a pattern in Programming Language? :: Pattern matching :: Regex OR Regular Expression 

Name begins with A and ends with O 

Zip code : Begins with 4 <4 digits in the middle - any combination> 0

https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_regex.asp

In case of Solace :: Queue name filters OR Topic filters can be all created using Regex :: Wildcards : * and >

<business> : zomato
<application/service> : customers
<what is the search crtiteria> : zip code
What is the value of the Zip code : <Specific> OR <Pattern>

Queue name structure : 

1. zomato/customer/zipcode/* :: Will search for all the customers in ALL the zip code

2. zomato/customer/zipcode/400100 :: Will search for all the customers in 400100 zip code

3. zomato/customer/zipcode/400/* :: Will search for all the customers in the zip code that starts with 400<any 3 combination> 

<business> : zomato
<application/service> : orders
<what is the search crtiteria> : city = Mumbai
What is the sub-search criteria :: Pizza 
Customers who ordered pizza below <sub criteria for the search> ::  Rs.200

Queue filter structure : 

zomato/orders/cityname=Mum/category-of-food=Pizza/ <less than 200>


Queue template :: There is NO owner :: Queue template can be used by NON-owners or ALL

Can we create a Queue-template using CLI ? :: YES

==>  Create a queue template ::

Queues/queue templates :: Utilize the storage :: Developer class :: message-spool --> message-vpn

show queue-template *

==> Show the details of a queue-template :

show queue-template <queue-temp name>  detail

show queue-template qtcli01 detail

==> Set a name filter for the queue-template

(configure/message-spool/queue-template)# name-filter <name>

name-filter zomato/customers/pin/*

==> Modify the message queue size :

(configure/message-spool/queue-template)# max-spool-usage 70

developer-production-bc64t4s47ll-solace-primary-0(configure/message-spool/queue-template)# permission all modify-topic


Queue Template :: Durability Override 

By default :: Whenever a client creates a queue template :: By default :: Durable nature

Modify the state of this durability of the queue :

(configure/message-spool/queue-template)# durability-overview [none | Non-Durable] 

==> change the durable status of the queue-template : durability-override [none | non-durable]

At the time of creating a queue template, if the durability status is : Non-Durable, it will remain Non-Durable

==> Modify the access type :

solace-primary-0(configure/message-spool/queue-template)# access-type [exclusive | non-exclusive]
solace-primary-0(configure/message-spool/queue-template)# access-type non-exclusive

Create a client-username : cu01

- Enable : ON or OFF

-->Whenever a Client-Username is created :: 2 bindings that needs to be done :

a. Client-Profile
b. ACL-Profile

Inside a client-username :

- Stats
- Queues owned by this client-username
- Topic endpoints owned by this client-username


Step1 : Access Control --> Client Username --> Created a new client-username :. Enabled + Client profile + ACL profile :: Default 

Step 2: Inside the newly created client-username + check --> queues/topic owned

Step3 : Created a new queue --> assigned the owner with the newly created Client-username

Step4 : Check the client-username --> queue ownership is available or not

==> Create the client usernames using Solace CLI

1. Create and configure the client-username

enable
configure

solace-primary-0(configure)# :

2. Configure in Client-user : assign the ACL Profile


a. Go inside the client-username :

client-username <username> message-vpn <mvpn-name> 

client-username cucli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

-solace-primary-0(configure)# client-username cucli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

--> Assign a ACL profile to the CU

(configure/client-username) : acl-profile <name of the profile> 

acl-profile default

3. Configure in Client-user : assign the Client-Profile

(configure/client-username) : client-profile <name>

client-profile default

(configure/client-username)# client-profile default

4. To see the list of the client-usernames :

(configure/client-username)# show client-username *

5. Enabling/Disabling of the client-username 

(configure/client-username)# no shutdown

ACL Profile :: Policies :: Allowed or Denied


Solace console --> Manage --> Access Control --> ACL Profiles

Client-usernames :: connect to a message-vpn


ACL profile : acp01


a. Client-connect : If the ACL profile is binded to a client-username : is it for Allow or Deny

b. Publish Topic : Whether the client-username with which "this" ACL profile is binded : will allow  for topic publish

c. Subscribe Topic :  Whether the client-username with which "this" ACL profile is binded : will allow  for topics can be subscribed




Publish Topic --> ACL Profile [client-user] : Allowed :: STOP a few --> list of exceptions

Client-connect --> IP Address :: Address format in exception :: CIDR format

What is CIDR : Classless Inter Domain Routing

IP address :: CIDR format :: With CIDR format, data routing becomes very efficient

Step 1: Create the ACL profile :: Allow all 3 permissions 

Step 2: Where can we use the ACL profiles :: Binding the client-usernames

==> Solace CLI :: ACL Profile

--> Create an ACL Profile + Configure the ACL Profile

enable

a. Check the list of client-usernames :: configure mode in CLI --> show client-usernames

exit
exit

(configure)# show client-username *

cucli01 


b. Inside the client-username : 

client-username <username> message-vpn <mvpn-name> 

client-username cucli01  message-vpn message-vpn-01 


c. Bind the username with the ACL profile :

(configure/client-username): acl-profile <profile name>

acl-profile aclcli01

==> Permission to the subscribe topic : default-action --> allow | deny

(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)# default-action allow


==> Add the exception to the subscribe topic :

(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)# exceptions list animals/domestic/>

exceptions list animals/domestic/* smf

Publish-topic or Subscribe-topic in ACL profile :: Exception list :: default protocol is SMF


(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)# exceptions list animals/jungle/* mqtt

ACL Pub/Sub-topics :: Exception list :: MQTT --> SMF
 


==> delete

(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)# delete animals/jungle02/*

 Invalid command input
        delete animals/jungle02/*
        ^
         -> unknown command, or command not available in current mode


What is the way to see the details of delete command, if any? 

delete ?

 Invalid command input

How to delete a subscriber-topic exception list of ACL profile using Solace Command

Everything that we create in Solace :: Object

generic commands :

- show
- create

Whenever an entity is to be created :: create <thing> 

==> Solace Console --> Manage --> Access Control --> Client Profiles

Analogy :

1. Vijay : Permission to attend Solace training : ACL 
2. Vijay : Skillsets : Theory/Handson/Comm/Behavioral/Critical thinking/Problem solving : Properties/Configuration :: Client-Profiles

1. What is a client profile in Solace?

https://docs.solace.com/Cloud/client-profiles.htm

Client-username : The pub-sub services/application of the business :: connect + communicate with Message-VPN

a. ACL Profile : What is allowed | denied :: Create a policy matrix :: Client-username vs Objects [publish/subscribe/client connect]


Client Profiles :: Common features/configurations that can applied to different client-usernames || Grouped together

Solace --> Client Profile 

Where can I add the client-profile?

Solace Console --> Manage tab --> Client Profile

Every solace account in PubSub+ Cloud :: Comes with a default client profile

Is it a possible to create a new client profile ? 

Queues [queue 06] --> Binded with an owner [owner --> client-username [cu03]] --> [cu03 --> ACL profile [permissions : allow/deny] + client- profile [set of config]] 

1. Create a new client profile
2. Create a client username :: Bind the CU with a new ACL profile + Client profile
3. Create a new queue :: Bind it with owner --> new client username 

client-profile 

client-username

==> Create client profiles using Solace CLI 

enable
configure

==> Create a client-profile + Configuration

Create a client-profile  : 

create client-profile <name> message-vpn <mvpn-name>

create client-profile cpcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

create client-profile cpcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

 Invalid command input
        create client-profile cpcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01
               ^
         -> unknown command, or command not available in current mode


The restrictions placed in the Developer Service Type 

Developer Service Type  --> You cannot access :: Solace CLI + Solace PubSub+ Cloud

- event insight :: Developer service class :: Account is not supported
- Logs being created : Can I open the log files :: Developer Service type :: NO

Solace --> Logs --> Migrate the log files from your a/c to DataDog/Splunk or any other server :: Feature is not supported in the developer service type

==> Client-Profile :: Create the client-profile using GUI BUT not using Solace CLI

Access Control :

- Client-usernames
- ACL profiles
- Client profiles

All these config details, all the permission details, all client username details :: Where are they stored ?  


Solace Console --> Manage --> Access Control --> Client-Authentication

Client Authentication :: Validating :: Against the data :: Data/records that are present ::

A. Internal database - Internal database. Authentication is against Client Usernames.

B. LDAP - LDAP authentication. An LDAP profile name must be provided.

C. RADIUS  - RADIUS authentication. A RADIUS profile name must be provided.


What is LDAP :: Light-Weight Directory Access Protocol 


==> How do you authenticate users in Windows OS?

==> How do you authenticate users in Linux OS?

--> Public Keys or Private Keys :: Key pairs

--> Certificates :: SSL Certificate or TLS Certificate :: Verizon/Symantec

Keys :

- Shared flat :: Key to enter the door [common key - Public key] + Closet --> Personal Key [Private key] 

Communication :: Client [each of the client instances --> Private Keys] <--> Server [Public Key]


Handshake :: Public <==> Private :: matches :: Connection is successful

- Properties of the key :: These keys are encrypted and NOT plain text [HASH :: One way algorithms] 

*nix env :: Key pairs for authentication :: machine[laptop] <==> servers :: USB Keys

How we can create our own key? :: Windows --> PuttyGen

PuttyGen download link : https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

Generate a key :: 

Click on generate --> Move the mouse randomly in the empty space

Communication :: Encrypted 

My URI [Publisher] ---------[EBS]--------> Server/Subscriber :: Https :: Valid certificates --> ensure that a specific algorithms are used for encryption

128-bit encryption
256-bit encryption
512-bit encryption 

Certificates :: Valid for a specific period of time 

Validity period :

Issued On	Saturday, July 16, 2022 at 12:42:31 PM
Expires On	Thursday, August 17, 2023 at 12:42:31 PM

My URI [Publisher] ---------[EBS]--------> Server/Subscriber :: Where are the solace certificates + what type of certificates does Solace support?

Solace Console --> Manage --> Certificate Authorities 

Types of certificate that Solace uses OOTB [out of the box]:

a. Client Certificate Authorities : Client Certificate Authorities are used to authenticate the identity of the "client to the server"

b. Domain certificate authorities : Domain Certificate Authorities authenticate the identity of the event broker service to clients and other event broker services

NOT allowing to load a sample certificate file ::  validating the "identity of the client to the server."

Client --> My account --> Add a demo certificate
<NO HANDSHAKE --> VALIDATION --> NULL]

Server --> Solace PubSub+ Host --> Nothing on the server side for the cert

--> You ideally MAY NOT be directly working with a hardware device :: 

Whenever changes in the happens --> Hardwares configuration has to be managed by the Solace Admin :: 

- Initial Setup
- Services : Up and down
- Replacement :: What are the config to be handled

Front Panels of v3530 :

LAG : Link Aggregation Group 

LACP : Link Aggregation Control Protocol

Hardwares --> Physical ports : 6-8 

- How the throughput from multiple network connections can be combined together and can be fed into a single connection
- LAG ensures that :: There is redundancy --> In case of failovers, if one of the physical links, the other physical links can work and take backup role

LAG :: Process --> Trunking + Bundling + Bonding + Channeling

Solace --> Appliance --> NAB --> LAG for communication :: High network bandwidth + HAA 

Active & Standby :: Solace --> HAA :: Backup + Redundancy 

In a network : 1 active LAG + Many standby LAG

If an active fails, then one of the standby's will take the active role

Network :: PDC vs BDC

PDC : Primary Domain Controller
BDC : Backup domain controller

In a network : 1 PDC and many BDC || If the PDC fails, one of the BDC's ------> PDC

Practice the CLI + GUI activities ::

message being published in a queue - 1 part 

how to specify the priorities for the message being queued - 2 part


MsgID - 1

Message Priority - 2

MsgID - 10

Message Priority - 9

Platinum member of a bank --> Call center number :: Privilege :: HIGH priority : less than 30 sec

subscriber.session = solace.SolclientFactory.createSession({
    // solace.SessionProperties
    url:      hosturl,
    vpnName:  vpn,
    userName: username,
    password: pass,
});
// define session event listeners
    /*...see section Session Events...*/
// define message event listener
    /*...see section Receiving a message...*/
// connect the session
try {
    subscriber.session.connect();
} catch (error) {
    subscriber.log(error.toString());
}

Where do we hold all the logic or the definitions programmatically that are used by API? :: SDK : Software Development Kit

API --> Try to use the functions [defined] --> SDK 

==> Is it possible to configure access type of queues in Solace CLI? :: YES --> HOW? 

access-type [exclusive | non-exclusive] 

Queue --> Access type is defined 

can i modify the access type directly? :: NO --> Shut down the queue

Guaranteed delivery in case of network failure ? :: YES

S1 : Where is the failure arising : Pub-EBS --> Boundary defition --> 

S2 : Where is the failure arising : EBS-Sub : ACK --> Subscriber has not "process" the message --> ACK is not sent and the message remains in the message spool of EBS

S3 : EBS Software OR EBS Appliance : Appliance --> ADB : Assured Delivery Blade 

What is the maximum size of queue that it can hold? == What is the range of message queued quota in Queue settings : 0 - <max number :: 6M MB> 

5000 - default
