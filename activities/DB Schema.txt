Schema
--> Skeleton of the database is created by the attributes:: skeloton is schema
--> mentioning the logical constraints:: tables, keys :: does not represent data type.

DB Schema
--> logical representation of data::shows how the data is organized and the relationship between the tables
--> contains table, field, views and relation between different keys::primary,secondary
--> data stored::in files::unstrucured--> makes accessin difficult::solution::structured using db schema
--> defines a set of guidelines that control the database:: provides information::way of accessing and modifying the data.

3 types:
Physical DB Schema
==> defines how the data is stored physically in the storage systems in the form of files & indices.
--> code or syntax needed to create the structure of a database

Logical DB Schema:
--> logical constraints:: describes tables, views, entity relationships, and integrity constraints. 
--> describes::how data is stored in the form of tables::how the attributes of a table are connected.
--> ER(Entity relationship) modelling::relationship b/w the components of the data is maintained.
--> different integrity constraints::to maintain the quality of insertion and update the data. 

View DB Schema:
--> interaction between end-user and database.
--> User::interact with the database:: help of the interface::without knowing about stored mechanism of data

To create schema:: mysql & sql server:: CREATE SCHEMA or CREATE DATABASE:: Oracle--> CREATE USER

Schema Designs
--> ineffective schema designs::difficult to manage & consume extra memory and resources
--> depends on the applicationâ€™s requirements.
