HAA
--> an operational component or system without any interruptions for extended periods
--> multiple components working together to guarantee uninterrupted service
--> solution to unplanned downtime and avoiding service disruptions
--> Downtime can lead to data loss
--> response time to usersâ€™ requests also has to be timely::available systems have to be online and responsive
--> moves the processes to backup components, minimizing downtime 

HAA Components:
Hardware redundancy 
Software and application redundancy 
Data redundancy
